# CubeSite
A cube website that you can use for a presentation, I used it for my portfolio.

You can update the content.js file and it will automatically build tables with links and labels. There is no limit of row and column but it's not fully responsive...

You can also remove the build_table() function and it will create a cube empty, without any table.

Don't forget to update the constant "parties" in the script.js file to update the titles in the menu.
